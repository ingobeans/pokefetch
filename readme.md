# POKEFETCH

Pokefetch is a simple CLI tool written in Rust that combines the functionality of pokemon-colorscripts and neofetch. It replaces the ASCII art generated by neofetch with a random Pok√©mon.

# Usage
`pokefetch` - prints out neofetch information with a random pokemon

`pokefetch -p totodile` - pokemon specified to be totodile

`pokefetch -p pikachu -f alola-cap -s` - shiny pikachu with the alola-cap form

`pokefetch -p totodile --disable cpu gpu` - passes the `--disable cpu gpu` args to neofetch to hide cpu & gpu information.
